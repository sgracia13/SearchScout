# SearchScout

# Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js

- I created an application using React that would allow a baseball scout 
to create a database of potential player names, positions and player evaluation notes. 
The app also has a weather check component built using the Open Weather API.
Baseball scouts travel to numerous small towns in any given one day. 
It is imperative that they know weather conditions since baseball is an outdoor sport. 

# Schema  



The application itself uses MongoDB to store all input data into collections. 
The server is built using Node.js and Express. The code snippet above shows 
the exact schema used to model the player into the database using Mongoose.
